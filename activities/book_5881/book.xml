        <title>Six factors of self-determination overlap and relate to each other</title>
        <content>&lt;h1 class="Subhead"&gt;Six factors of &lt;span class="nolink"&gt;self-determination&lt;/span&gt; overlap and relate to each other&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we have explored six factors that affect an individual’s ability to be self-determined, let’s again consider our first guiding question, which asks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What does it mean for an adult with LD to be self-determined?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you may have noticed, the six factors seem to overlap and relate with one another. In addition, although we presented them in a particular order, they do not represent a step-by-step process. Factors can be addressed by learners or instructors in any order and/or simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This overlap and integration can be confusing – not only to our learners with LD, but also ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

        <content>&lt;h1 class="Subhead"&gt;Activity: Depicting the relationships and influences of the six &lt;span class="nolink"&gt;self-determination&lt;/span&gt; factors&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please take a moment to consider what you have learned about the six factors. If you were asked to create a visual model or describe an analogy of how these six factors support the process of becoming self-determined, what would it look like/be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How might you depict ways in which the six factors that influence &lt;span class="nolink"&gt;self-determination&lt;/span&gt; relate to and influence one another?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you have finished your reflections, click the &lt;b&gt;forward arrow&lt;/b&gt; to proceed.&lt;/p&gt;

        <content>&lt;h1 class="Subhead"&gt;Tree analogy depicts the &lt;span class="nolink"&gt;self-determination&lt;/span&gt; model&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we present an example of a model of &lt;span class="nolink"&gt;self-determination&lt;/span&gt; attempting to represent how the six factors relate to one another. This model uses a tree analogy to depict&lt;span class="nolink"&gt; self-determinatio&lt;/span&gt;n and the six factors.&lt;/p&gt;

These represent the factors of Plan (green), Be Proactive (orange), and Reflect and Readjust (blue). There are arrows between these factors showing a left-right (green to orange to blue) progression. Under these three trees, ‘in support’, is a solid box with stylized roots coming out of the bottom. In this box are Gain Self-Awareness and Learn to Value Yourself (the roots/base for Plan, Be Proactive and Reflect and Readjust). A double headed arrow shows a back-and-forth relationship between Gain Self-Awareness and Learn to Value Yourself. An arrow stretches around the graphic from Reflect and Readjust to this “root area” of Gain Self-Awareness and Learn to Value Yourself. Another arrow leads to and from this area up and around to Plan. Written vertically on each side of this graphic is the word Environment. Bulleted lists of related elements are listed below each factor (except Environment)." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="nolink"&gt;Gaining self-awareness&lt;/span&gt; and learning to value yourself - the foundations of &lt;span class="nolink"&gt;self-determination&lt;/span&gt; – are shown in this model as the roots of a tree.&lt;/p&gt;

        <content>&lt;h1 class="Subhead"&gt;Blue tree represents &lt;span class="nolink"&gt;reflecting and readjusting&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="nolink"&gt;Reflecting and readjusting&lt;/span&gt; is represented by the blue tree, which is beginning to shed its leaves. To be self-determined, an individual must be able to learn from his or her experiences. For a tree, winter is a time of pause in the growing process, just as reflection and readjustment mean taking time to stop and consider the outcomes of a person’s efforts. This includes deciding what to continue and what to change for next time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="nolink"&gt;environment&lt;/span&gt; is surrounding the entire image. Continuing with the metaphor of a tree, the &lt;span class="nolink"&gt;environment&lt;/span&gt; would be like the sun and soil, elements that feed the tree’s growth. We can structure learning &lt;span class="nolink"&gt;environments&lt;/span&gt; in ways that either promote or inhibit &lt;span class="nolink"&gt;self-determination&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <content>&lt;h1 class="Subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="nolink"&gt;Self-Determination&lt;/span&gt; model shows the interrelationship of the six factors&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This graphic/analogy provides a good overview of how each of these six factors interrelate to support the process of becoming self-determined. A printer-friendly version of the &lt;span class="nolink"&gt;Self-Determination&lt;/span&gt; Model is provided at the end of this course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This now leads us to our next guiding question and activity. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.231;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="@@PLUGINFILE@@/Self%20Determination%20tree%20graphic.jpg" width="550" height="356" alt="A graphic depiction of the “Self-Determination Model.” Central in image are three stylized trees in green, orange, and blue, left to right.
